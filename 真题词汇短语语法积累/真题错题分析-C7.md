## Passage 1

**Why pagodas don’t fall down**



***Questions 5-10\***

*Classify the following as typical of*

*Write the correct letter, A, B or C, in boxes 5-10 on your answer sheet.*

5 easy interior access to top  

6 tiles on eaves  

7 use as observation post  

~~8 size of eaves up to half the width of the building~~  

9 original religious purpose  

~~10 floors fitting loosely over each other~~  



这里面5,6,7,9错

5. access可以翻译成到达、通道，结合文章中指楼梯 => 单词理解

6. tile翻译成砖，做题时以为是倾斜，理解严重偏差 => 单词理解

7. observation post  和文章中的watchtowers是同义 => 单词理解

9. 原文中As in China，as应该理解为“就像”，引导比较状语，不是“当” =>  状语句法理解



总结：4个问题都是单词理解问题，基础不扎实，多积累词汇量，认识的单词要扩展含义，多读文章，理解as在不同句子中的含义，有“就像”， “当”， “因为”等多种含义引导比较、时间、原因等状语。

## Passage 2

**The true cost of food**



***Questions 14-17\***

Reading Passage 2 has seven paragraphs, A-G.

*NB    You may use any letter more than once.* 



15 the stages in the development of the farming industry

16 the term used to describe hidden costs



15. 完全是文章整体理解不到位，答案句有Fisrt... then ... then .. and now ...，明确的表示过程的连词 => 段落理解
16. term 翻译成“术语”，一般和refer to ... as ...，as后面跟着术语，完全是把这个单词理解错了 => 单词理解





***Questions 22-26\***

*Complete the summary below.*

*Choose NO MORE THAN THREE WORDS from the passage for each answer.*

*Write your answers in boxes 22-26 on your answer sheet.*



Professor Pretty concludes that our 22. are higher than most people realise, because we make three different types of payment.

Professor Pretty wants the government to initiate change by establishing what he refers to as a 25. . He feels this would help to change the attitudes of both 26. and  26. 



22.Are  复数，肯定用复数名词，填了个单数，并且句子也没找到 => 句子定位

23.句子没找到 => 句子定位

25.句子里提到refers to as，称之为...，我填个standard过于宽泛了，应该是文中具体提到的标准 => 短语理解



总结：错了5个，问题比较分散，有一个题目中单词理解 term的基础问题，强化记忆即可，2个句子定位以及段落理解问题，纯粹是阅读过少，需要多读，多看，看快的同时句子大体意思也不能出现大的偏差，最后1个短语理解问题，强化记忆 refer to ... as ...：将...成为...

28 Section C   

30 Section F 



28.段落理解问题，选的答案只是其中一小点，不是整段的主题 => 段落理解

30.段落理解问题，选项和段落最后一句都提到了future，一般heading题着重关注首尾的句子 =>段落理解

这三个题目分布在连着的三个段落里，38把37的答案选了，导致答案都错了，37和39句子都没找到 => 段落理解



总结：这里除了有1个争议的单词问题，其他5个都是段落理解不到位，需要提升句子泛理解能力

2.city和原文中urban同义，the forcing house表示温床 => 单词理解

首先注意一下标题中的“Additional”，额外的证据，这样直接就能知道对应段落首句”Others feel there is more of a case for the theory.“，没好好审题 ，导致定位完全出错，三个选项全部做错！ => 审题问题



总结：除去T/F题，填词题完全在于自己没审题，忽视了行文逻辑。
