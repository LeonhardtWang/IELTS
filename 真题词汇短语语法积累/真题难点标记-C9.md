## Passage 1

**William Henry Perkin**

**The man who invented synthetic dyes**

 

William Henry Perkin was born on March 12, 1838, in London, England. As a boy, Perkin’s curiosity prompted early interests in the arts, sciences, photography, and engineering. But it was a chance **==stumbling==[^stumble: v.偶然发现] upon**[^stumble upon：发现] a ==run-down==[^破旧的], yet ==functional==[^功能齐全的], laboratory in his ==late==[^已故的] grandfather’s home that solidified the young man’s enthusiasm for chemistry.

 

As a student at the City of London School, Perkin became ==immersed==[^沉浸的；专注的] in the study of chemistry. His talent and devotion to the subject were perceived by his teacher, Thomas Hall, who encouraged him to attend a series of lectures given by the eminent scientist Michael Faraday at the Royal Institution. Those speeches fired the young chemist’s enthusiasm further, and he later **went on to**[^go on to do sth.：继续做某事] attend the Royal College of Chemistry, which he **succeeded in**[^succeed in doing sth.：成功做某事] entering in 1853, at the age of 15.

 

At the time of Perkin’s enrolment, the Royal College of Chemistry was headed by the noted German chemist August Wilhelm Hofmann. Perkin’s scientific gifts soon caught Hofmann’s attention and, within two years, he became Hofmann’s youngest assistant. **Not long after**[^……不久之后] that, Perkin made the scientific breakthrough that would bring him both fame and fortune.

 

At the time, quinine was the only ==viable==[^切实可行的] medical treatment for ==malaria==[^疟疾]. The drug **is derived from**[^be derived from：源自于] the bark of the ==cinchona==[^金鸡纳树] tree, native to South America, and by 1856 demand for the drug was surpassing the available supply. Thus, when Hofmann **made some ==passing==[^随便的；这里引申义“随口的”] comments about**[^make comments about：对……发表评论] the desirability of a synthetic substitute for quinine, it was unsurprising that his ==star pupil==[^得意门生] **was moved to**[^be moved to do sth.：被打动去做某事] **take up**[^接受] the challenge.

 

During his vacation in 1856, Perkin spent his time in the laboratory on the top floor of his family’s house. He was **attempting to**[^attemp to do sth.：试图做某事] manufacture quinine from ==aniline==[^苯胺], an inexpensive and ==readily==[^容易地] available ==coal==[^煤] ==tar==[^焦油] ==waste product==[^废料]. Despite his best efforts, however, he did not **end up with**[^最终得到] quinine. Instead, he produced a mysterious dark ==sludge==[^沉淀物]. Luckily, Perkin’s scientific training and nature prompted him to investigate the substance further. ==Incorporating==[^incorporate：v. 混合] ==potassium==[^钾] ==dichromate==[^重铬酸盐] and alcohol into the aniline **at various stages of**[^在……的不同阶段] the experimental process, he finally produced a deep purple ==solution==[^溶液]. And, proving the truth of the famous scientist Louis Pasteur’s <u>words ‘chance favours only the prepared mind’</u>[^引号里的话解释words], Perkin saw the potential of his unexpected find.

 

Historically, textile dyes were made from **such** natural sources **as**[^such ... as ...：诸如(as)……的……] plants and animal ==excretions==[^排泄物]. Some of these, such as the ==glandular==[^腺的] ==mucus==[^黏液] of ==snails==[^蜗牛], were difficult to obtain and ==outrageously==[^凶残的；引申义“极其”] expensive. ==Indeed==[^实际上], the purple colour extracted from a snail was once so costly that in society at the time only ==the rich==[^n. 富人] could afford it. Further, natural dyes **tended to**[^tend to do：倾向于] be ==muddy==[^浑浊的] in ==hue==[^颜色] and fade quickly. <u>It was ==against==[^prep. 以……为背景] this ==backdrop==[^背景] that Perkin’s discovery was made.</u>[^强调句：被强调部分是 “against this backdrop”（在这样的背景下），它是一个介词短语，在原句中作状语]

 

Perkin quickly grasped that his purple solution could be used to colour fabric, thus making it the world’s first synthetic dye. Realizing the importance of this breakthrough, he **lost no time in**[^lose no time in doing sth.：立即做某事] patenting it. But perhaps the most fascinating of all Perkin’s reactions to his find was his ==nearly==[^几乎] ==instant==[^马上的] ==recognition==[^识别] that the new dye had commercial possibilities.

 

Perkin originally named his dye Tyrian Purple, but it later became commonly known as mauve (from the French for the plant used to make the colour violet). He asked advice of Scottish dye ==works==[^工厂] owner Robert Pullar, who ==assured==[^assure：v.向……保证] him that manufacturing the dye would be well worth it if the colour remained ==fast==[^不褪色的] (i.e. would not fade) and the ==cost==[^成本] was relatively low. So, ==over==[^prep. 尽管] the fierce objections of his mentor Hofmann, he left college to **give birth to**[^使诞生] the modern chemical industry.

 

With the help of his father and brother, Perkin **set up**[^建立] a factory not far from London. Utilising the cheap and plentiful coal tar that was an almost unlimited byproduct of London’s gas street lighting, the dye works began producing the world’s first synthetically dyed material in 1857. The company received a commercial ==boost==[^推动；促进；引申义“繁荣”] from the ==Empress==[^皇后] Eugenie of France, when she decided the new colour ==flattered==[^flatter：v.使高兴] her. Very soon, mauve was the necessary ==shade==[^色调] for all the fashionable ladies in that country. Not to be ==outdone==[^outdo：v.胜过；超过], England’s Queen Victoria also appeared in public wearing a mauve gown, thus making it all the ==rage==[^风靡一时] in England as well. The dye was ==bold==[^明显的] and fast, and the public ==clamoured==[^clamour：v.强烈要求] for more. Perkin **went back to the drawing board**[^go back to the drawing board：重新规划].

 

Although Perkin’s <u>fame was achieved</u> and <u>fortune assured</u>[^省略了 “was”，完整形式为 “was assured”，与 “fortune” 搭配，表示 “财富被确保”] by his first discovery, the chemist continued his research. <u>Among other dyes he developed and introduced were aniline red (1859) and aniline black (1863) and, in the late 1860s, Perkin’s green.</u>[^完全倒装句。正常语序应该是 “Aniline red (1859) and aniline black (1863) and, in the late 1860s, Perkin’s green were among other dyes he developed and introduced”] It is important to note that Perkin’s synthetic dye discoveries had outcomes far beyond the merely decorative. The dyes also became vital to medical research **in many ways**[^在许多方面]. **For instance**[^例如], they were used to stain previously invisible microbes and bacteria, allowing researchers to identify such ==bacilli==[^细菌] as ==tuberculosis==[^肺结核], ==cholera==[^霍乱], and ==anthrax==[^炭疽]. Artificial dyes continue to play a crucial role today. And, <u>in what would have been particularly pleasing to Perkin</u>[^插入语成分。其中 “what would have been particularly pleasing to Perkin” 是一个宾语从句，作介词 “in” 的宾语。在这个宾语从句中，“what” 充当主语，表示 “…… 的事情”], their current use is **in the search for**[^在寻找…… 方面] a vaccine against malaria.
